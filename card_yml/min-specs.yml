  Invitation
  In the context of a challenging activity, a new initiative, or a strategic bottleneck, invite participants to generate a list of all the do's and don'ts they should pay attention to in order to achieve a successful outcome (Max Specs)
  Ask participants to reduce the previous list to the absolute minimum needed to achieve their purpose (Min Specs)

  People
  Start alone, then small groups of 4 to 7, then the whole group

  Space & Materials
  - Groups of 4 to 7 chairs around small tables
  - Paper to record Max and Min Specs
:back_body: |-
  Steps
  Starting alone, each participant generates their Max Specs list

  Repeat the process, this time in small groups. Make list as complete as possible

  Each group sifts through the list one item at a time and eliminates every rule that gets a positive answer to:
  “If we broke or ignored this rule, could we still achieve our purpose?”

  Do a second round if needed

  Consolidate across groups to the shortest possible list
