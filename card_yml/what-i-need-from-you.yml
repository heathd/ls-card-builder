  Steps
  Explain the process

  Clusters use 1-2-4-All (or 1-2-All) to make a list of their top needs from each of the other clusters in the room using the format:
  “What I need from you is ... ”

  Spokespersons gather and state their top two needs 1-by-1 to each other

  Spokespersons (with group) write down one of four responses to each request: Yes, No, I will try, Whatever

  Spokepersons repeat their requests and share their responses
  (No discussion! No elaboration!)
