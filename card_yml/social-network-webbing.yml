  Steps

  Each member writes their name on a Post-it and puts it in the wall

  “What people do you know that are active in this work?”
  “Who else would you like to include in this work?”
  Create a spider-web-like map

  Draw connecting lines to illustrate influencing patterns

  Devise strategies to strengthen the network
