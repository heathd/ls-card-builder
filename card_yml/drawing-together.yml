  Steps
  Introduce the concept and symbols

  Practice drawing the symbols

  Working individually, combine the symbols to create the first draft of a story about “the journey” of working on a challenge or an innovation

  Create a second draft. Refine the story by dramatizing the size, placement and color of the symbols

  Invite another individual or the small group to interpret your drawings. The person who has done the drawing does not speak

  Ask the whole group: “Together, what do the drawings reveal?”
