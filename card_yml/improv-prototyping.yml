  Steps
  Explaing the process

  Describe the scenario

  Players on stage enact the scene

  Each group debriefs with 1-2-4-All to identify successful and unsuccessful “chunks” from the observed scene

  Each group pieces together the successful chunks into a new prototype. Volunteers act out the new prototype for their own group

  Participants from one of the groups who believe they have an improved prototype come on stage and enact their version for the whole group
