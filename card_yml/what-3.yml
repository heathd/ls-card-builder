  Steps
  Individuals work 1 min alone on “What happened? What did you notice, what facts or observations stood out?”
  Then, 2-7 mins in small groups

  Salient facts are shared with the whole group and collected

  Repeat the same process with:
  “Why is that important? What patterns or conclusions are emerging? What hypotheses can I/we make?”

  Then with:
  “Now what? What actions make sense?”
