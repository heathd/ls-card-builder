  Steps
  In pairs, participants take turns conducting an interview and telling a success story. Pay attention to what made success possible

  In groups of 4, each person retells the story of their partner. Listen for patterns in conditions/assets supporting success and take notes

  Collect insights and patterns for the whole group on a flip chart

  Ask: “How are we investing in the assets and conditions that foster success?” and “What opportunities do you see to do more?”
