  A - Action (opporunities to act on ideas)
  R - Reason to work together

  People
  Start alone, then small groups, then the whole group

  Space & Materials
  - Tables for small groups of 4, with a STAR compass graphic and pens for each individual
  - A STAR compass graphic on a flip-chart page for each small group & one for the whole group

  Steps
  Participants individually assess where the team is in regard to each of the four elements

  In small groups, participants place a dot along each compass point, then talk with their neighbors (1-2-4) about their placements, looking for consensus and differences

  Small groups decide what type of results are generated by the pattern of interaction they have identified

  Small groups brainstorm action steps to boost elements needing attention

  Whole group assembles list of action steps and decides: “What first steps can we take right now?”
