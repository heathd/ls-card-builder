  Steps
  Introduce the purpose of HSR:
  To practice listening without trying to fix anything or make any judgments

  One at a time, each person has 7 minutes to share their story

  Partners share with one another the experiences of listening and storytelling

  In a foursome, participants share reflections using 1-2-4, asking, “What patterns are revealed in the stories? What importance do you assign to the pattern?”

  Whole group reflects on how HSR could be used to address challenges revealed by the patterns
